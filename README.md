# Harmonization of the WHO Family of International Classifications
Maps and other materials developed for WHO-FIC harmonization.

## Background
The Family of International Classifications of the World Health Organization currently includes three reference classifications, namely International Classification of Diseases (ICD), International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), and International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI). Each of them serves a specific classification need. However, they share some common concepts that are present, in different forms, in two or all of them.  To understand the possible commonalities relationships among the three classifications, an effort is needed to compare them, identifying common areas, gaps, and compatible and incompatible modeling. It is the aim of a current WHO effort to harmonize the shared concepts among the reference classifications of the family in the Foundation. 

Here we collect maps (and eventually other material) that has been developed to reach this aim.

## Sources
Most of the work involves the WHO-FIC Foundation, accessible at https://icd.who.int/dev11/f/en .

## Anatomy
One important set of shared concepts is the representation of human anatomy entities, which are not always modeled in the same way and with the same level of detail. The first task tackled by the Working Group on Harmonization focused on the anatomy representations in ICF and ICD-11 by mapping anatomical entities in the two classifications. 

The first artifact produced is a set of maps from ICF Body Structures to ICD-11 Anatomic detail (from Extension codes): https://github.com/whoficitc/harmonization/blob/main/ICF-ICD-anatomy-v1.tsv

## TO DO
- replication of the mapping work to ICHI anatomical targets;
- mapping of related impairments of ICF to symptoms in ICD-11;
- an overall analysis of represented concepts in the family of classifications.
