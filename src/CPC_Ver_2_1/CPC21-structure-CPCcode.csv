This group also includes melons, watermelons, and mushrooms. Vegetables cultivated mainly for animal feed or cultivated only for their seeds are excluded.Vegetables are grouped here according to botanic characteristics as follows: leafy or stem vegetables (with leaves, stems, and/or flowers edible, e.g., cabbages and cauliflowers); fruit-bearing vegetables (with edible fruits, e.g., melons); root, bulb and tuber vegetables (with roots, bulbs, and/or tubes edible, e.g., onions); green leguminous vegetables (containing green grains and green pods, e.g., green peas); other vegetables n.e.c.
